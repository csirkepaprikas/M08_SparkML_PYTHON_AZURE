## This module is dedicated to Spark ML.

Machine Learning (ML) is an essential component of modern data platforms, and a valuable addition to Databricks. The ML task is designed to provide me with a basic understanding of data analysis, as well as practical skills in using the framework to visualize data and uncover valuable insights.
Through this assignment, I learned how to leverage the Databricks platform to discover hidden gems within my data.
