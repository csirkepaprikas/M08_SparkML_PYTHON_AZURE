## This module is dedicated to Spark ML.

Machine Learning (ML) is an essential component of modern data platforms, and a valuable addition to Databricks. The ML task is designed to provide me with a basic understanding of data analysis, as well as practical skills in using the framework to visualize data and uncover valuable insights.
Through this assignment, I learned how to leverage the Databricks platform to discover hidden gems within my data.

## Preparation
First I created the source container, where the terraform's backend willbe stored.

![source_cont](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccb0cde3-8bba-4375-98c4-bf411ba1bbf3)

Then modified the main.tf file:
```python
# Setup azurerm as a state backend
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "h" # <== Please provide the Resource Group Name.
    storage_account_name = "h" # <== Please provide Storage Account name, where Terraform Remote state is stored. Example: terraformstate<yourname>
    container_name       = "hw3"
    key                  = "bdcc.tfstate"
  }
}

# Configure the Microsoft Azure Provider
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  subscription_id = "6" ## <== Please provide your Subscription ID.
}

data "azurerm_client_config" "current" {}

resource "random_string" "suffix" {
  length  = 2
  special = false
  upper   = false
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "bdcc" {
  name     = "rg-${var.ENV}-${var.LOCATION}-${random_string.suffix.result}"
  location = var.LOCATION

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = false
  }

  tags = {
    region = var.BDCC_REGION
    env    = var.ENV
  }
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "bdcc" {
  depends_on = [
  azurerm_resource_group.bdcc]

  name                     = "${var.ENV}${var.LOCATION}${random_string.suffix.result}"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.bdcc.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.bdcc.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = var.STORAGE_ACCOUNT_REPLICATION_TYPE
  is_hns_enabled           = "true"

  network_rules {
    default_action = "Allow"
    ip_rules       = values(var.IP_RULES)
  }

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = false
  }

  tags = {
    region = var.BDCC_REGION
    env    = var.ENV
  }
}

resource "azurerm_storage_data_lake_gen2_filesystem" "gen2_data" {
  depends_on = [
  azurerm_storage_account.bdcc]

  name               = "data"
  storage_account_id = azurerm_storage_account.bdcc.id

  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = false
  }
}

resource "azurerm_databricks_workspace" "bdcc" {
  depends_on = [
    azurerm_resource_group.bdcc
  ]

  name                = "dbw-${var.ENV}-${var.LOCATION}-${random_string.suffix.result}"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.bdcc.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.bdcc.location
  sku                 = "premium"

  tags = {
    region = var.BDCC_REGION
    env    = var.ENV
  }
}

output "resource_group_name" {
  description = "The name of the created Azure Resource Group."
  value       = azurerm_resource_group.bdcc.name
}
```

Then created the infrastructure with the "terraform init", "terraform plan" and "terraform apply" commands:

```python
c:\data_eng\házi\3\terraform>terraform init
Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "azurerm"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.
Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding hashicorp/azurerm versions matching "~> 4.3.0"...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/random...
- Installing hashicorp/azurerm v4.3.0...
- Installed hashicorp/azurerm v4.3.0 (signed by HashiCorp)
- Installing hashicorp/random v3.7.1...
- Installed hashicorp/random v3.7.1 (signed by HashiCorp)
Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the
following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Here you can see the newly created resource groups in the West Europe location:

![new_RGs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32252426-f2ab-4b00-aa87-e5f563ed3f66)

And the source and the destination containers:

![new_containers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04ce7c92-4359-4a90-b78b-fc826ff086d0)

I also uploaded the source files:

![Uploading source_files.png…]()

Then I started to work on the notebook related tasks. First I created the tables from the source files: winequality-red.csv and winequality-white.csv:

![table_create_red](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41e5cf39-d5c9-419d-9a37-20e76e8a5a11)
![table_create_white](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e18e8b9-b383-4b1e-bd1e-5fa7b7df6d72)

Here you can see the created tables:

![created_tables](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b2ce6e0-4d49-4cf2-8270-7439748513f5)

Also uploaded the files in the DBFS:

![dfbs_file_save](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5907abf8-ead2-4d63-ad65-a16d5864a1b3)

I reviewd the whole ML notebook via articles, tutorials and AI then I created a new notebook where I devided the original to smaller parts.
The first is the ###Seaborn:
```python
# COMMAND ----------

import pandas as pd

white_wine = pd.read_csv("/databricks-datasets/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv", sep=";")
red_wine = pd.read_csv("/databricks-datasets/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv", sep=";")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Merge the two DataFrames into a single dataset, with a new binary feature "is_red" that indicates whether the wine is red or white.

# COMMAND ----------

red_wine['is_red'] = 1
white_wine['is_red'] = 0

data = pd.concat([red_wine, white_wine], axis=0)

# Remove spaces from column names
data.rename(columns=lambda x: x.replace(' ', '_'), inplace=True)

# COMMAND ----------

data.head()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Visualize data
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Before training a model, explore the dataset using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Plot a histogram of the dependent variable, quality.

# COMMAND ----------

import seaborn as sns
sns.displot(data.quality, kde=False)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Looks like quality scores are normally distributed between 3 and 9. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Define a wine as high quality if it has quality >= 7.

# COMMAND ----------

high_quality = (data.quality >= 7).astype(int)
data.quality = high_quality

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Box plots are useful for identifying correlations between features and a binary label. Create box plots for each feature to compare high-quality and low-quality wines. Significant differences in the box plots indicate good predictors of quality.
